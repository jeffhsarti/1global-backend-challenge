# Device Management API

## üí° Description

This project provides a RESTful API for managing a collection of devices, supporting updates, filtering by brand or state, and enforcing domain-level business rules.

It is built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **TypeScript**, and follows a clean architecture with well-defined layers (Domain, Application, Infrastructure). The application uses **PostgreSQL** for persistence and is fully **containerized using Docker**.

The API is well-tested, documented, and ready for integration into larger systems or standalone use in device inventory management contexts.
